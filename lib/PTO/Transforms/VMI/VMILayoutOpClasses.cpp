//===- VMILayoutOpClasses.cpp - VMI layout op classification --------------===//
//
// Operation-class predicates the costed layout solver needs.  They live in
// their own unit because the cost model calls isVMILayoutCastOp and therefore
// drags the definition into any full link: keeping it next to the propagator's
// isVMISameLayoutOp keeps the two classifications side by side, and the planner
// that consumes them must not define them again.
