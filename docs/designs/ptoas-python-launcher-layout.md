# PTOAS Python Launcher Layout Design

## Purpose

This document records the internal launcher contract for the Python-backed
`ptoas` command. The user-facing README should describe how to install and run
PTOAS without exposing these implementation details.

The PTOAS-owned MLIR Python runtime lives under `ptoas.mlir`; its namespace and
native-library isolation requirements are recorded separately in
[`ptoas-mlir-namespace-and-native-isolation.md`](ptoas-mlir-namespace-and-native-isolation.md).

## Entry Model

The wheel launcher uses the standard Python console-script and native-extension
model. Build-tree and install-tree entrypoints are narrow CMake adapters around
the same Python CLI and native extension:

```text
wheel console script -> ptoas._cli.main()
CMake tree wrapper   -> add its own Python root -> ptoas._cli.launch()
both                 -> import ptoas._core -> ptoas._core.main(argv)
```

`ptoas._core` is the single PTOAS-owned native extension. It provides the
compiler entry point and the native PTO dialect bindings used by the public
`ptoas.mlir.dialects.pto` facade. CMake and Python own the platform and ABI-specific
filename. Launcher and packaging code refer to the import name and never
construct `.so`, `.dylib`, or `.pyd` paths.

The LLVM-based driver implementation is compiled as an object library so it
can use LLVM's RTTI and exception settings independently from pybind11. Those
objects are linked into the Python extension; no separate native executable is
produced. Wheel and standalone-archive entrypoints therefore use the same
extension and CLI module.

## Wheel Layout

Wheel console scripts point directly to `ptoas._cli:main`. The CLI imports the
native extension through Python's normal package machinery and resolves TileOps
package data relative to the installed extension. It does not re-execute itself,
load modules by file path, rewrite `PYTHONPATH`, or override Python's standard
package precedence rules.

Editable installs use scikit-build-core's redirect mode. The backend maps the
Python sources to the checkout and the CMake-installed native extension to the
editable build output without package-local path manipulation.

Auditwheel and delocate discover the native extension through the standard
wheel binary scan, bundle its dependencies, and rewrite its runtime search
paths. The launcher does not preload or enumerate those libraries.

Wheel and editable builds use `scikit-build-core` directly as the PEP 517/660
backend. Project metadata and the console entry point live in `pyproject.toml`;
wheel tags, metadata, RECORD generation, CMake configure/build/install, and
editable redirects are owned by the backend rather than repository scripts.

The main `pyproject.toml` has the static distribution name `ptoas`.
`packaging/ptoas-vmi/pyproject.toml` is a second static PEP 621 project for the
mutually exclusive `ptoas-vmi` distribution. Both projects build the same CMake
source and install the same `ptoas` import package. This keeps project names
standards-compliant because PEP 621 does not permit a dynamic `project.name`.

CMake's `PTOAS_Python` install component contains only the generated/native
wheel payload. Python source packages are declared through
`tool.scikit-build.wheel.packages`, which also lets editable installs redirect
imports to the source tree without namespace-package or custom `.pth` logic.

## Build-Tree Layout

The build-tree wrapper resolves only its own generated outputs:

- wrapper: `<build>/tools/ptoas/ptoas`
- Python root: `<build>/python`
- native module: importable as `ptoas._core` from the Python root
- TileOps: `<build>/python/ptoas/_runtime/share/ptoas/TileOps`

Missing Python packages or TileOps resources are hard layout errors. The
wrapper only adds `<build>/python` to `sys.path`; `ptoas._cli` owns the common
runtime-resource resolution and native invocation.

## Install-Tree Layout

The install-tree wrapper resolves only files under the same prefix:

- wrapper: `<prefix>/bin/ptoas`
- Python root: `<prefix>`
- native module: importable as `ptoas._core` from the Python root
- TileOps: `<prefix>/ptoas/_runtime/share/ptoas/TileOps`

The install-tree wrapper only adds `<prefix>` to `sys.path`, then delegates to
the same `ptoas._cli` module used by wheels.

Both tree wrappers are CMake packaging adapters, not general runtime discovery
helpers. Each wrapper adds exactly the Python root belonging to its own tree;
it never scans repositories, neighboring build directories, or environment
variables for another installation.

## Standalone Archive Layout

Standalone compiler archives contain the installed Python wrapper and package:

```text
bin/ptoas
ptoas/_cli.py
ptoas/_core.<abi>.so
ptoas/_runtime/share/ptoas/TileOps
ptoas/mlir/
ptodsl/
lib/<native dependencies>
tilelang_dsl/
```

The archive is assembled by installing `PTOAS_Python` and then
`PTOAS_CompilerArchive` into one staging prefix. The second component owns the
wrapper and compiler-time Python resources and performs relocation against the
already staged native payload. Packaging code does not scan source trees or
assemble Python packages from unrelated build directories.

The current archive is built against CPython 3.11 and requires a CPython 3.11
interpreter. `bin/ptoas` adds the archive root to `sys.path`, then uses the same
`ptoas._cli -> ptoas._core` path as the install tree. The packaged `ptodsl/`
tree supports the compiler's default PTODSL TileLib backend; it does not turn
the archive into a normal pip-installable PTODSL distribution.

Linux archives use package-relative and archive-relative `$ORIGIN` RPATHs;
macOS archives use the equivalent `@loader_path` install names. Package-owned
MLIR extensions remain under `ptoas/mlir/_mlir_libs`, while only external
native dependencies are collected under the archive `lib/` directory.

## PTODSL and TileLib Runtime

PTODSL imports MLIR and the PTO dialect through normal Python package
resolution. Wheel and editable installs provide those packages through their
declared installation layout. CTest and direct developer-tree runs must set an
explicit matching `PYTHONPATH`; PTODSL does not guess repository, LLVM build,
or PTOAS install paths at import time.

TileOp expansion remains a lazy, separate daemon process. The PTOAS CLI passes
the packaged PTODSL root and the active Python executable to the native driver,
which starts the daemon only when expansion is required. Keeping the daemon out
of the compiler process also prevents independently packaged MLIR/LLVM Python
bindings from registering runtime state in the native PTOAS process.
